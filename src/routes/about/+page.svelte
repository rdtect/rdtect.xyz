          My passion lies in working and designing at the <strong

          As a practicing Architect, I had designed <strong>visually appealing</strong
          > parametric forms and spaces. Now, use technology to create digital
          products like digital illustrations, publications, websites, and 3D models.
        </p>

          My interest in UI-UX aligns with my vision of Architecture, <strong
            >motivating me to create user experiences</strong
          >. I've shared my knowledge of Architecture and UI-UX at DIT
          University and started my own studio, where I've created both physical
          and virtual products. I was an early adopter of WEB3 and NFTs, and I'm
          the creator of the world's first
          <strong>crowdfunded NFT Bollywood movie</strong>
          (now available on Disney+ Hotstar). I was also invited to become a co-founder
          and the <strong> Metaverse Architect for Quantlabs</strong>, where we
          designed and implemented a
          <strong>Virtual Durga Puja Platform</strong>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Besides creating 3D models in Blender and designing in Figma, I enjoy
          coding in Python and JavaScript. I've also worked as a Front-End
          Engineer. I'm passionate about creating functional UI and interactive
          websites; I primarily use Svelte, and have an understanding of
          Three.js and Babylon.js. I'm a proponent of open-source technology,
          and am excited to learn Godot 4.

          I thrive when working and designing at the <strong
